This repo attempts to streamline the modeling of cell signaling via the STEPS package 
(https://steps.sourceforge.net/STEPS/default.php) and is very much a work in progress.

To run it in parallel use ``mpirun -n N python3 run.py`` with N as the number of CPU cores
you want to use.

Be aware of the options in ``run.py`` and adjust them accordingly.
